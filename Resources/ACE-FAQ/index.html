  <h1>ACE FAQs</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <h3 id="which-classes-have-ace-resources-available">Which classes have ACE resources available?</h3>
<p>ACE is offered most quarters for MATH 19/20/21, MATH 41/42, MATH 51/52/53, and CME 100/102/104 sequences. There are also some resources available for the PHYSICS 41/43/45 series and other courses. (Here, I’ve focused on ACE for the CME 10[x] courses, since this is the program I’ve been involved with the most and have the best knowledge of.)</p>

<h3 id="what-is-ace">What is ACE?</h3>
<p>ACE is a supplementary instruction program run through the School of Engineering Engineering Diversity Programs (headed by Dr. Noe Lozano). We meet for a weekly section, hold ACE-specific review sessions, and provide tutoring and other resources to students in the program. The requirements for ACE are in addition to the regular requirements for CME 10[x], and for your extra work you receive one extra unit of course credit. (If you are enrolled in ACE, you take CME 10[x]A for 6 units instead of CME 10[x] for 5 units.) More information is available <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/students/programs/engineering-diversity-programs/additional-calculus-engineers">here</a></p>

<p><em>Note:</em> ACE is primarily a supplementary instruction program and the program revolves around group learning in weekly sections. If you are interested mainly or exclusively in receiving one-on-one tutoring, these resources may also be available through Dr. Lozano’s office, but you should contact his office directly to request these.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-requirements-for-ace">What are the requirements for ACE?</h3>
<p>The main requirement is mandatory weekly section attendance. You are allowed one unexcused absence, and need to make up any other excused absences for the rest of the quarter. Section will start week 2, and we will hold section every week for the rest of the quarter.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-get-into-ace">How do I get into ACE?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Apply online at: http://web.stanford.edu/dept/soe/osa/ace.fb</li>
  <li>Email your CA to let them know that you are interested in or planning on enrolling so they can make sure you are on the final roster. Depending on the CA, class size, etc. you may also need to fill out a (short) additional form to help the CA keep track of everyone who’s interested.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-do-i-know-when-im-accepted">How do I know when I’m accepted?</h3>
<p>Pending your application is reviewed and you’re accepted to the program, Dr. Noe Lozano (noe@stanford.edu) will follow up with you with an acceptance email and the access code. You are only accepted to the ACE program if you receive a confirmation from Dr. Lozano. Correspondences with ACE CAs, including announcements and section policies, are not equivalent to an acceptance to the program.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-im-not-sure-about-doing-ace">What if I’m not sure about doing ACE?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re on the fence about doing ACE, feel free to come to the first section to check it out. Unfortunately, because of the attendance policy, if you decide to do ACE but do not show up the first week, we are forced to count that first missed section as your unexcused absence for the quarter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you do not wish to enroll for 6 units but believe you would benefit from the program, we are also open to having students audit ACE section as long as you participate in the program the same as an ACE student (e.g. show up to section weekly, participate in review sessions, etc.).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-do-i-enroll-in-cme-10xa-for-6-units">How do I enroll in CME 10[x]A for 6 units?</h3>
<p>You should enroll in the course for 5 units first. Pending your application is reviewed and you’re accepted into the program, during week 2 or 3 of the quarter Dr. Noe Lozano will follow up with the access code and instructions for how to enroll in CME 10[x]A for 6 units.</p>
