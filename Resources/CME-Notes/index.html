  <h1>CME Series Notes</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Since Spring 2015, I’ve worked as a course assistant (CA) for the <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/students/programs/engineering-diversity-programs/additional-calculus-engineers">ACE program</a>. Most of my time as a CA for this program has been spent working with Prof. Hung Le in CME 100 and 102, and in the process I have developed a large number of materials for these courses.</p>

<p>As a side project, I set out to make section notes for my CME 102 students. The general idea was to make lecture notes that were clean, easily-digestible, and high-quality, since these were something I found lacking in a lot of online resources for the material in math and engineering courses. A big inspiration for these notes was <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/">Andrej Karpathy’s notes for CS 231N</a> on deep learning, which clearly and concisely teaches you the bare essentials for deep learning. In general, the machine learning/deep learning/AI community has a ton of great blog posts and other resources for learning about that field. I’m hoping these can provide a similar resource for introductory differential equations.</p>

<p>In the pages linked below, I’ve compiled all of my course notes and ACE section materials. I hope that this provides a centralized resource for students in Stanford’s undergraduate CME series (and perhaps even for students from other schools in similar classes). <em>Note:</em> these notes are not meant to replace the course readers for these classes, and certainly are not a substitute for class attendance. They are just a compilation of notes and practice problems from an experienced TA.</p>
